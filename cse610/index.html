<h1>CSE610: Selected Topics in Web Security, 2019 Spring</h1> </br>

 <font size="+1">
Instructor: Prof. Weihang Wang </br>
Office: Davis 338G </br>
E-mail: weihangw@buffalo.edu </br>
Office hours: Wed 12:00PM – 2:00PM @ Davis 338G </br></br>

Time and Place: Wed, 2:00PM - 4:40PM @ 	Baldy 111 </br></br>

<h3>Course Description:</h3> 
<!--Security flaws are commonly found in web applications. Over the past two decades, the research community has proposed various mechanisms to mitigate certain web vulnerabilities. With the evolution of web technologies, the arms race between researchers and adversaries continues. 
-->
This course is based on research-oriented projects in the web security field. Topics include measuring vulnerable web standards and their usage in the wild, designing tools to automatically enforce security critial rules/standards, 
exploring side channel attacks on the web, evaluating offensive web advertisements on a large scale, and detecting malware by leveraging program analysis techniques, etc. 
</br>

Students are expected to work on one group (of 3~5 students) project throughout the semester. The projects are open problems that students will gain experience in designing effective defenses/attacks and implementing the techniques. We will also discuss background knowledge and techniques in the form of paper presentations.</br></br>


<h3>Prerequisites: </h3>
The course requires substantial critical thinking and implementation effort. In order to successfully complete the project, students have prior experience in memory model, control flow integrity, instrumentation on browser internals/browser extensions, and/or program analysis are preferred.
</ul>  

<!--
<h3>Course Structure: </h3>
This class has no exam. The grading is based on paper presentations and projects. Only satisfactory (S) and unsatisfactory (U) will be given.
</br>
<b><i>Paper presentations:</i></b> we will discuss 4 papers each week. Each student will be expected to present 1-2 papers and lead discussions. These papers are selected from recent publications from top conferences in security. 
</br>
<b><i>Projects:</i></b> students who registered more than 1 credit need to complete a project. For the project, students are expected to demo the code implementation during office hours and write a report with a description of how to run the code. A template for the report will be given. 
Students are also welcome to propose their own project. Please come to the instructor’s office hours or make an appointment to discuss the topic of the project. 
</br>
