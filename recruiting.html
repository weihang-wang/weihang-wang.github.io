<h3>Information for Prospective PhD Students:</h3>
Thank you for your interest in my research group at USC. The group is broadly interested in software engineering, software security, machine learning, and computer systems. Our vision is to build testing and analysis techniques for improving the reliability, security, and efficiency of complex software systems. Some of our ongoing projects include static/dynamic bug detection, program analysis for WebAssembly, attack investigation and detection, compiler testing, and performance profiling. You can read about our work on my webpage: https://weihang-wang.github.io/.

<h3>Candidate Qualifications:</h3>
I am looking for bright and motivated PhD students to join my group in Fall 2023. I am excited to work with students who (1) are committed to top-notch research, (2) have a solid background in system programming, and (3) have experience with building large software systems. Research experience in software engineering, security, or compilers is a plus.

<h3>About the PI:</h3>
I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Southern California. Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo (UB). I earned my PhD in Computer Science from Purdue University in 2018. My research interests are software engineering, software security, and computer systems. My work has been published in top-tier venues in software engineering (ICSE, FSE, ASE, and ISSTA), security (S&P and NDSS), measurement (IMC), and web (WWW). In recognition of my research contributions, I was awarded a UB Exceptional Scholar - Young Investigator Award in 2022, an NSF CAREER Award in 2021, a Facebook Testing and Verification Research Award in 2019, a Mozilla Research Award in 2019, and a Maurice H. Halstead Memorial Research Award in 2018.
