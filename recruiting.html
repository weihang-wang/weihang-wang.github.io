<h3>Information for Prospective PhD Students:</h3>
<p>
  Thank you for your interest in my research group at USC. The group is broadly interested in software engineering, software security, machine learning, and computer systems. Our vision is to build testing and analysis techniques for improving the reliability, security, and efficiency of complex software systems. Some of our ongoing projects include static/dynamic bug detection, program analysis for WebAssembly, attack investigation and detection, compiler testing, and performance profiling. You can read about our work on my webpage: https://weihang-wang.github.io/.
