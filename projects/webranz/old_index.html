We prepared a pre-randomized web-site for you. It is a main page of the "Yahoo.com".
We saved a snapshot of the web page and randomized it. Then, uploaded the web page along with the original web page.
We recommend you to check the website with "Firefox" and "Adblock Plus". 
The randomized web page will show the advertise in the center of the web page even though Adblock Plus is enabled, while 
the original web page's advertisements are removed by Adblock Plus.

<font size=5><b>What is WebRanz?</b></font><br/>
WebRanz is a tool that randomizes web pages so that the contents of the randomized 
web pages can be protected and preserved. For example, the advertisements in the randomized web pages 
are not removed by Adblockers such as AdBlock Plus. In addition, it naturally protects the web pages 
from web bot attacks, as most web bots rely on predefined id and classnames to locate specific DOM elements.
For example, Figure 1 shows a running example. 
It shows three screen shots of a web-site without Adblock Plus and with Adblock Plus, 
as well as randomized website with Adblock Plus. Our high-level goal is to preserve all the visible elements and their layouts
including advertisements against Adblock Plus by randomizing the web pages.
The red boxes represent the advertisements and their places. The red arrows point the Adblock Plus icons. 
The gray icon means it is disabled, the red icon means it is enabled and preventing advertisements.<br/>

<br/>
As shown in Figure 1, the first case which is the original web page without Adblock Plus shows two advertisements.
In the second case, the original web page with Adblock Plus, there is no advertisements showing as they are blocked by Adblock Plus.
In the last case, the randomized web page with Adblock Plus, all advertisements are shown even with Adblock Plus due to our 
randomizations.<br />

<font size=5><b>How it works?</b></font><br/>
WebRanz analyzes web pages and randomizes id and class names as well as CSS contents as 
any of these names can be used to locate or identify a specific element on a web page. Figure 2 shows an example of such randomization on HTML code. On the left side, the code of original web page is shown. 
On the right side, the randomized web page is shown. The red boxes are ids and classnames. On the left side, the first red box contains "header", "logo", and "tabs", which are transformed into "rand_id_29099", "rand_class_892", and "rand_class_27487" respectively.

<br/>
By randomizing the ids, classnames, and urls, it can protect web contents from other plug-ins which try to locate or identify certain elements in web pages.
However, benign accesses to DOM objects can be also affected. To handle that, WebRanz dynamically maintains a mapping between randomized ids/classnames and original ids/classnames and translates them at runtime.
