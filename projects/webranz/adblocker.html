			<h2>Advertisements?</h2>
			<span class="byline">
			Advertisements on websites can exist in various forms including flash movies, images, popups, and texts. Figure 1 shows some advertisements on CNN.com website <br/>
			<br/>

			<h2>What are Ad-blockers?</h2>
			<span class="byline">
			<b><font color=red>Ad-blockering or ad-filtering</font></b> is removing or altering advertisements in a web page, and 			
			Ad-blockers are essentially programs that implement ad-blocking methods. <br />
			<br />

			While there are many different ways to implement Ad-blockers, 
			the most common and popular ad-blockers are browser extensions. 
			<br/>

			For instance, <b><font color=red>Adblock Plus</font></b> is the leading browser extension for blocking ads.
			A user can install the extension on the Chrome web-browser in the Web Store. Once it is installed, 
			it automatically detects and prevents advertisements in a web page.
			
			Specifically, it removes the advertisements by blocking the advertisement loading process via URL filtering 
			and hiding the DOM elements that have certain ids or names.
			<br/>
			<br/>
						
			</span>

			<h2>Popuplar Ad-blockers</h2>
			<span class="byline">
			<img src=adblockers.png><br/>
			Figure 2. Two popular ad-blockers, Adblock and Adblock Plus.<br/>
			<br />
			There are many ad-blockers: Adblock, Adblock Plus, Adblock Pro, Adblock for Youtube, and etc. Figure 2 shows two popular ad-blockers, Adblock and Adblock Plus. Among them, <b><font color=red>Adblock Plus</font> is the leading Ad-blocker which is used by most users.</b> 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<i><font color=red><b>Note that </b>WebRanz evaluates the effectiveness on <b>Adblock Plus</b> as it is <b>the most common and widely spreaded ad-blocker</b>.</font></i><br />
			<br />
			One can simply install the Adblock Plus through the Chrome WebStore (<a href=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb?hl=en-US target=blank>link</a>). 
			On its product page one can simply click the "Add to Chrome" button on the top right to install as shown in Figure 3.<br />
			After the installation, Adblock Plus icon will be added as a toolbar, next to the address window of the browser, 
			and it  automatically removes advertisements on web pages. 
			<br />

			<h2>How it works?</h2>
			<span class="byline">
			Most ad-blockers prevent advertisements via <b>URL</b> and <b>DOM elements filters</b>. 
			<b>The URL filter</b> is a list of URLs that are used to deliver advertisements. 
			Once such URL is detected, Ad-blockers block network connections to and from such URLs, preventing the delivery of advertisements.<br />
			However, some advertisements are delivered through URLs that are also used to deliver non-ad contents. 
			As these URLs are indistinguishable, preventing such URLs often breaks the website. 
			To block such advertisements cannot be blocked via URL filters, Ad-blockers identify DOM elements related to 
			advertisements on the web page and hide the elements. <br />
			To implement URL and DOM element filters, Ad-blockers often use a predefined list that includes 
			all known advertisements' element ids, names, and URLs.
			<br />
			<br />
			In particular, EasyList is one of the most popular list. Figure 4 shows some parts of the EasyList. <br />
			<br />
			<img src=easylist.png><br/>
			Figure 4. EasyList contains patterns for advertisement related URLs and DOM element ids and names.<br/>
			<br />
			For example, as shown in the Figure 4, network connections with URLs including "shtfplan.com/images/banners" will be blocked by Adblock Plus as it is listed in the EasyList.<br />
			<br/>
			<img src=easylist2.png><br/>
			Figure 5. DOM element id patterns in EasyList<br/>
			<br />
			Figure 5 shows some DOM element id and name patterns in the EasyList. The highlighted pattern "##.textAdBlock" means that Adblock Plus will hide DOM elements that have textAdBlock in their names or ids.
