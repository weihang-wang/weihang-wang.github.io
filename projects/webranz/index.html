			We prepared a pre-randomized web-site for you. It is a main page of the "Yahoo.com".
			We saved a snapshot of the web page and randomized it. Then, uploaded the web page along with the original web page.
			We recommend you to check the website with "Firefox" and "Adblock Plus". 
			The randomized web page will show an advertisement in the center of the web page even though Adblock Plus is enabled, while 
			the original web page's advertisements are removed by Adblock Plus.

			<h2>What is WebRanz?</h2>
			<span class="byline">
				WebRanz is a tool that randomizes web pages so that the contents of the randomized 
				web pages can be protected and preserved from Ad-blockers<font color=red>[*]</font> and Web bots<font color=red>[+]</font>. For example, the advertisements in the randomized web pages 
				are not removed by Adblockers such as AdBlock Plus. In addition, it naturally protects the web pages 
				from web bot attacks, as most web bots rely on predefined id and classnames to locate specific DOM elements.
				For example, Figure 1 shows a running example. 
				It shows three screen shots of a web-site without Adblock Plus and with Adblock Plus, 
				as well as randomized website with Adblock Plus. Our high-level goal is to preserve all the visible elements and their layouts
				including advertisements against Adblock Plus by randomizing the web pages.
				The red boxes represent the advertisements and their places. The red arrows point the Adblock Plus icons. 
				The gray icon means it is disabled, the red icon means it is enabled and preventing advertisements.<br/>
				<br/>

				<b>Figure 1. Screen shots side by side.</b><br/>
				<br/>
				As shown in Figure 1, the first case which is the original web page without Adblock Plus shows two advertisements.
				In the second case, the original web page with Adblock Plus, there is no advertisements showing as they are blocked by Adblock Plus.
				In the last case, the randomized web page with Adblock Plus, all advertisements are shown even with Adblock Plus due to our 
				randomizations.<br />

			<h2><font color=red>[*]</font> What is Ad-blocker?</h2>
			<span class="byline">
			<b>Ad-blocker</b> is a piece of software that allows a user to roam the web without encountering any Ads. 
			In particular, it utilizes network control and in-page manipulation to help users block most online advertisements. Network control
			barricades HTTP requests to Ads and thus prevents themfrom loading. In-page manipulation looks up Ads based on pre-determined patterns 
			and makes them invisible. Want to know more about Ad-blockers? <a href=adblocker.html>Please check "Ad-blockers?" page out.</a>

			<br />
			<h2><font color=red>[+]</font> What are Web bots?</h2>
			<span class="byline">
			<b>Web bots</b> are programs that simulate user browsing behavior. 
			They read the HTML code, analyze the content and interact with the web app just like humans. 
			Web bots are commonly used for various purposes such as searching, scraping and impersonation. 
			According to a recent study on 20,000 popular websites by Incapsula Inc., out of 15 billion visits observed, 
			56% of all traffic is generated by bots. Want to know more about Web bots? <a href=webbots.html>Please check "Web bots?" page out.</a>

		<div class="title">
			<h2>Why WebRanz?</h2>
			<span class="byline">
				WebRanz protects and preserve the contents including legitimate advertisements from Adblockers or web bots.<br />
				While adblockers have many benefits to the end users, it is also destroying web service ecosystems especially those 
				who depend on the advertisement incomes. WebRanz protects such web services and makes the web ecosystem sustainable. <br/>
				In addition, WebRanz also prevents web bots so that the service quality is not affected by hogging web bots. <br/>

				<a href=why.html>More details can be found in "Why WebRanz?" page.</a>
				<br/>
				<br />
			</span>

		<div class="title">
			<h2>How it works?</h2>
			<span class="byline">
				WebRanz analyzes web pages and randomizes id and class names as well as CSS contents as 
				any of these names can be used to locate or identify a specific element on a web page. Figure 2 shows an example of such randomization on HTML code. On the left side, the code of original web page is shown. 
				On the right side, the randomized web page is shown. The red boxes are ids and classnames. On the left side, the first red box contains "header", "logo", and "tabs", which are transformed into "rand_id_29099", "rand_class_892", and "rand_class_27487" respectively.
				<br/><br/>
				<img src=fig2.png><br />
				<b>Figure 2. An example source code of a randomized web page.</b><br/>
				<br/>
				By randomizing the ids, classnames, and urls, it can protect web contents from other plug-ins which try to locate or identify certain elements in web pages.
				However, benign accesses to DOM objects can be also affected. To handle that, WebRanz dynamically maintains a mapping between randomized ids/classnames and original ids/classnames and translates them at runtime.
