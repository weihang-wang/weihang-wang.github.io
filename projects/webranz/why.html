			<h2>Why WebRanz?</h2>
			<span class="byline">
			
			<font color=black><b>Advertisements are everywhere and important.</b></font> We are surrounded by many different types of ads. 
			According to IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report, the revenue of U.S. web advertising is as large as <b>$15 billion</b> in Q3 2015.
			Advertisement is one very important income source of many web services.<br />
			<br/>
			<font color=black><b>Adblocking may devastate the economic system in the long run.</b></font>  

			Ad-blocker is a piece of software that allows a user to roam the web without encountering any Ads.
			(<a href=adblocker.html>More details on ad-blockers can be found here</a>) 
			While it is useful and beneficial to users, ad-blockers are <b>double sided swords</b>. Many content publishers make their primary legitimate income from Ads. However, <b>Ad-blocking is destroying this ecosystem</b>. In 2014, Google made $59.1 billion from advertising, but <font color=black><b>lost $6.6 billion due to Ad-blocking</b></font> (<a href=http://blog.pagefair.com/2015/google-losingbillions-adblock-devils-deal/ target=_blank_source>source</a>). During 2015, <b>Ad-blocking has cost Internet companies almost <font color=black>$22 billion</font>. The number will rise to <font color=black>$41.4 billion</font> in 2016</b> (<a href=http://blog.pagefair.com/2015/ad-blocking-report/ target=_blank_source>source</a>). Many games-related websites currently encounter about <b><font color=black>50% revenue loss</b> due to Ad-blocking</font> (<a href=http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/04/09/growth-of-ad-blocking-adds-to-publishers-worries/ target=_blank_source>source</a>). It is suggested that if everybody used Adblockers, Ad-supported Internet services would vanish.<br />
			<br/>
			<center><table><tr><td align=center><font color=black size=4><b>"<i>It's
			the websites that ad-block users most love that are going out
			of business first. This is to no one's benefit</i>"</font></b></td></tr><tr><td align=right> - The Wall Street Journal -</td></tr></table></center>
			<br/>
			<font color=black><b>Ad-blockers also block legitimate contents.</b></font> 
			Unfortunately, adblockers often mistakenly block legitimate non-ad contents, breaking the web site. 
			Such errors caused by adblockers can directly impact the functionality of a web service and the business too. The web service may lose potentially customers, impacting the business negatively.
			<br />
			<br/>
			<font color=black><b>Beside advertisement, web bots are also problematic.</b></font> While web bots are useful to automate various 
			tasks, enabling many new technologies, they are often also harmful.
			As malicious web bots such as spam bots destroy web sites especially communities, many web sites nowadays use Captcha to prevent web bots as shown in Figure 1. (<a href=webbots.html> Please check out "Web bots?" page for details about web bots</a>)
			<br/>
			<br />

			<br />

			<font color=black size=5><b><i>WebRanz deals with the above two important issues via web site randomization.</i></b></font> <br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>First,</b> WebRanz randomizes DOM elements and URLs in order to protect and preserve the web contents from AdBlockers.
			As the Adblockers identify advertisement using URLs or DOM element name/id patterns, they are not able to 
			identify advertisements on randomized web pages. As a result, <b><font color=black>WebRanz preserves advertisements on the web pages, 
			protecting the revenue of the web site from adblockers so that the web service can be sustainable. </font></b>
			<br/ >
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Second,</b> web bots are simply not working on randomized web pages by WebRanz, as the bots depend on DOM element id and name patterns. 
			Once the web site is randomized, web bot simply cannot find an element of its interest. This immediately <b><font color=black>prevents any further accesses or 
			attacks from web bots, protecting web sites from web bots.</font></b><br />

			<h2>Essence of WebRanz</h2>
			<span class="byline">
			<b><font color=black>The essence of WebRanz is the randomization of web pages</b></font>, 
			while we focus on protecting web sites from Adblockers and Web-bots.<br/>
			<br/>
			To the best of our knowledge, WebRanz is <b><font color=black>the first system to randomize DOM elements and URLs to protect web pages</b></font> from other programs that 
			access web pages. While adblockers and web-bots are two popular applications we mentioned in the paper, the application of WebRanz is not 
			limited to them.<br /><br/>
			<b><font color=black>WebRanz explores a new way of protecting contents via randomization</font></b>. During our evaluation, we encountered many interesting challenges due to 
			the complexity of ad-delivery systems, and our artifact WebRanz includes answers to such challenges.<br />
			<br/>
			In addition, WebRanz also preserves the original contents on randomized web pages.<br/>
			To achieve this, we have implemented <b><font color=black>a runtime system that 
			intercepts and translates all DOM accesses at runtime</b></font>. Essentially, WebRanz implements a thin layer between dynamic HTML elements such 
			as JavaScript and static DOM elements. 
			</span>
			<br/><br/>

			<h2>Why is it relevant to SE?</h2>
			<span class="byline">			
			The idea as well as the implementation of WebRanz is inspiring the future of software engineering research.<br/>
			<br/>
			First, our analysis results on ad-delivery system are helpful to future research on advertisement ecosystems. Our findings, design, and implementations essentially reflect 
			the nature of advertisement ecosystems, enabling more detailed analysis on ad-delivery systems.<br/>
			<br/>
			Second, we have explored how advertisements are technically delivered in practice. Our design and implementation include many insights and observations. 
			For example, the delivery of advertisement is highly dynamic and involving many different domains and different techniques such as Script Injection, DOM Element Injection, and AJAX.<br/>
			<br/>
			Third, our design and implementation are general (not limited to the ad-delivery system), and can facilitate future research on web contents delivery and protection. For example, WebRanz intercepts various complex dynamic 
			interactions between DOM and JavaScript. Such framework (WebRanz) is beneficial to any kind of analysis on complex content delivery system.
			Also, while WebRanz interposes complex technologies to protect the contents, it also preserves the original intent of contents which is challenging.<br/>
			Such experience and the implemented artifact are very valuable for any future research on contents delivery and its protection.<br />
